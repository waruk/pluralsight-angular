# Anatomy of an Angular application:
components + services  
component = 
- template (html view) 
- class (code for the view) 
- metadata (additional information about the component)

Modules group components together. An angular app has at least the root module. Modules generally corespond to application features?

# Typescript
- transpiles to JavaScript
- Typescript type definition files: *.d.ts
- uses class-based OOP

# Setting up the environment
- install npm (it is bundled with node.js)
- set up Angular application
  - manually
  - Angular CLI
